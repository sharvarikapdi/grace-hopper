          <p>
          Dr. Grace Murray Hopper was a trailblazing technologist. Nicknamed the First Lady of Software, she invented compiled programming languages while working on the very earliest electronic computers. <br />
          Grace patriotically left her university post as a popular math professor at Vassar to enlist in the US Navy during WWII. She was almost denied entry ~ due to her "advanced" age {37} and physical condition {16 pounds underweight} ~ but went on to become one of the military's most celebrated researchers. After 43 years of service, she retired at the age of 80 as a Rear Admiral and the Navy's oldest serving officer.
          </p>
          <p>
            During her time in the Navy, Hopper was one of the first people to program the enormous IBM-built calculator called the Harvard Mark I and its successors. And she famously popularized a phrase in the computing lexicon when a moth was found wedged in one of the system's relays: she attached the offending insect to a fault report, describing her work as "debugging" the massive Mark II.
          </p>
          <p>
            Following the war, Hopper returned to the private sector and worked on the Univac computing platform. She would, however, continue her work with the Navy Reserves throughout her career, retiring in 1986 with the rank of Rear Admiral.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1952, she invented the first software compiler, the A-0, which built machine code from mathematical instructions. Hopper's most famous contribution came in 1959 when she developed COBOL to allow users to interact with computers using common language statements. The language has endured for decades and undergone numerous revisions.
          </p>
          <p>
            On New Year's Day 1992, Hopper died in her sleep of natural causes at her home in Arlington, Virginia; she was 85 years of age. She was interred with full military honors in Arlington National Cemetery.
